    <div class="info">
    <p>Programming is the art and science of instructing computers to perform specific tasks and solve problems. It is a fundamental skill in our increasingly digital world, allowing humans to communicate with machines through a structured set of instructions. Programmers use various programming languages, like C, Python, or JavaScript, to write code that tells computers what to do. Programming is a creative and problem-solving endeavor, requiring logical thinking and attention to detail. It empowers us to develop software applications, websites, games, and automation tools that have transformed industries and shaped our daily lives. As technology continues to advance, programming remains a key driver of innovation and a vital skill for those who seek to harness the full potential of computing.</p>
